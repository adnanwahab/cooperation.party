1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Big man!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey, Kel!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Or soda!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It sucks!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It sucks!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Kel,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think the door not opening

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
might have something to do with that

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
big chain that's like around it.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The chain, the chain. Oh, what kind of inhuman

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
monster would do this, huh?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Look out, Papa.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Chris, Chris, what, some

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
sicko that put a chain around an orange soda cooler?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Kel, Chris, it's the sicko.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What, what's wrong with you?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Kel, do you know that last month you drank over $100

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
worth of free orange soda?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Really? I thought it was so much more.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It was plenty!

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
From now on, if you want orange soda, you'll have to pay for it.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And until you pay up, the chain

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
stays put.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I ain't gonna, I'll pay you back!

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The rules been,

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the rules been,

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I need orange soda in my life!

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I don't have orange soda, I can't live!

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't live!

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll be in the back fussing with my hair.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Kel, you all right?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Whoa!

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Whoa!

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Whoa! Orange soda!

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can't do this to me! You can't do this to me!

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Kel, why don't you just pay for the orange soda?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, like where am I supposed to get

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
some money? Oh, if only

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I could do things for people in a cave

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
for money.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You mean like get a job?

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
