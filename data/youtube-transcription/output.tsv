6000	8000	It sucks!
8000	10000	It sucks!
10000	12000	Kel,
12000	14000	I think the door not opening
14000	16000	might have something to do with that
16000	18000	big chain that's like around it.
18000	20000	The chain, the chain. Oh, what kind of inhuman
20000	22000	monster would do this, huh?
22000	24000	Look out, Papa.
24000	26000	Chris, Chris, what, some
26000	28000	sicko that put a chain around an orange soda cooler?
28000	30000	Kel, Chris, it's the sicko.
30000	32000	What, what's wrong with you?
32000	34000	Kel, do you know that last month you drank over $100
34000	36000	worth of free orange soda?
36000	38000	Really? I thought it was so much more.
38000	40000	It was plenty!
40000	42000	From now on, if you want orange soda, you'll have to pay for it.
42000	44000	And until you pay up, the chain
44000	46000	stays put.
46000	48000	I ain't gonna, I'll pay you back!
48000	50000	The rules been,
50000	52000	the rules been,
52000	54000	I need orange soda in my life!
54000	56000	If I don't have orange soda, I can't live!
56000	58000	I can't live!
64000	66000	I'll be in the back fussing with my hair.
76000	78000	Kel, you all right?
78000	80000	Whoa!
82000	84000	Whoa!
84000	86000	Whoa! Orange soda!
86000	88000	You can't do this to me! You can't do this to me!
96000	98000	Kel, why don't you just pay for the orange soda?
98000	100000	Yeah, like where am I supposed to get
100000	102000	some money? Oh, if only
102000	104000	I could do things for people in a cave
104000	106000	for money.
106000	108000	You mean like get a job?
108000	110000	Get a job!
