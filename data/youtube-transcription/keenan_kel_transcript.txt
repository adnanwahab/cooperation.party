[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  big chain that's like around it.

[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  What, what's wrong with you?

[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  worth of free orange soda?
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  Really? I thought it was so much more.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  It was plenty!
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  From now on, if you want orange soda, you'll have to pay for it.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  And until you pay up, the chain
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  stays put.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  I ain't gonna, I'll pay you back!
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  The rules been,
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  the rules been,
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  I need orange soda in my life!
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  If I don't have orange soda, I can't live!
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  I can't live!
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  I'll be in the back fussing with my hair.

[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  You can't do this to me! You can't do this to me!
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  Kel, why don't you just pay for the orange soda?
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  Yeah, like where am I supposed to get
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  some money? Oh, if only
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  I could do things for people in a cave
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  for money.
