health  insurance  coverage  shall,  with  respect  to  each  plan 
year,  provide  an  annual  rebate  to  each  enrollee  under  such 
coverage,  on  a  pro  rata  basis,  in  an  amount  that  is  equal 
to  the  amount  by  which  premium  revenue  expended  by  the 
issuer  on  activities  described  in  subsection  (a)(3)  exceeds— 
‘‘(A)  with  respect  to  a  health  insurance  issuer  offering 
coverage  in  the  group  market,  20  percent,  or  such  lower 
percentage  as  a  State  may  by  regulation  determine;  or

coverage  in  the  individual  market,  25  percent,  or  such 
lower  percentage  as  a  State  may  by  regulation  determine, 
except that such percentage shall be adjusted to the extent 
the  Secretary  determines  that  the  application  of  such 
percentage  with  a  State  may  destabilize  the  existing  indi-
vidual market in such State. 
‘‘(2)  CONSIDERATION IN SETTING PERCENTAGES.—In  deter-
mining  the  percentages  under  paragraph  (1),  a  State  shall 
seek  to  ensure  adequate  participation  by  health  insurance 
issuers,  competition  in  the  health  insurance  market  in  the 
State,  and  value  for  consumers  so  that  premiums  are  used 
for clinical services and quality improvements.

plan  shall  be  responsible  for  reimbursing  the  program  under

Secretary,  the  Secretary  finds  was  encouraged  by  the  issuer

for  the  prior  coverage  exceeded  the  premium  required

applied to the prior coverage)— 

(I)  the  prior  coverage  is  a  policy  that  is  no 
longer  being  actively  marketed  (as  defined  by  the 
Secretary) by the issuer; or 

(II)  the  prior  coverage  is  a  policy  for  which 
duration  of  coverage  form  issue  or  health  status 
are  factors  that  can  be  considered  in  determining 
premiums at renewal.

construed  as  constituting  exclusive  remedies  for  violations  of 
criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing States

determination under this section; and

(g) FUNDING; TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.— 

(1)  IN GENERAL.—There  is  appropriated  to  the  Secretary, 
out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, 
$5,000,000,000  to  pay  claims  against  (and  the  administrative 
costs  of)  the  high  risk  pool  under  this  section  that  are  in 
excess  of  the  amount  of  premiums  collected  from  eligible 
individuals  enrolled  in  the  high  risk  pool.  Such  funds  shall 
be available without fiscal year limitation. 

(2)  INSUFFICIENT FUNDS.—If  the  Secretary  estimates  for 
any  fiscal  year  that  the  aggregate  amounts  available  for  the 
payment  of  the  expenses  of  the  high  risk  pool  will  be  less 
than  the  actual  amount  of  such  expenses,  the  Secretary  shall 
make  such  adjustments  as  are  necessary  to  eliminate  such 
deficit. 

(3) TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.— 

(A)  IN GENERAL.—Except  as  provided  in  subparagraph 
(B),  coverage  of  eligible  individuals  under  a  high  risk  pool

individuals  enrolled  in  health  insurance  coverage  offered 
through  a  high  risk  pool  established  under  this  section 
into  qualified  health  plans  offered  through  an  Exchange. 
Such  procedures  shall  ensure  that  there  is  no  lapse  in 
coverage  with  respect  to  the  individual  and  may  extend 
coverage  after  the  termination  of  the  risk  pool  involved, 
if the Secretary determines necessary to avoid such a lapse. 
(4)  LIMITATIONS.—The  Secretary  has  the  authority  to  stop 
taking  applications  for  participation  in  the  program  under  this 
section  to  comply  with  the  funding  limitation  provided  for  in

(5)  RELATION TO STATE LAWS.—The  standards  established 
under  this  section  shall  supersede  any  State  law  or  regulation 
(other  than  State  licensing  laws  or  State  laws  relating  to  plan 
solvency)  with  respect  to  qualified  high  risk  pools  which  are 
established in accordance with this section.

tiated  price  concessions  (such  as  discounts,  direct  or 
indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect remunera-
tions)  obtained  by  such  plan  with  respect  to  such  health

retiree’s spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent in the form 
of  deductibles,  co-payments,  or  co-insurance  shall  be 
included  in  the  amounts  paid  by  the  participating  employ-

a  participating  employment-based  plan  has  submitted  a  valid 
claim  under  paragraph  (1),  the  Secretary  shall  reimburse  such 
plan  for  80  percent  of  that  portion  of  the  costs  attributable 
to  such  claim  that  exceed  $15,000,  subject  to  the  limits  con-

$90,000. Such amounts shall be adjusted each fiscal year based

to the nearest multiple of $1,000) for the year involved. 

(4)  USE OF PAYMENTS.—Amounts  paid  to  a  participating 
employment-based  plan  under  this  subsection  shall  be  used

(a)(2)(B)(i)  or  to  reduce  premium  contributions,  co-payments, 
deductibles,  co-insurance,  or  other  out-of-pocket  costs  for  plan 
participants. Such payments shall not be used as general reve-
nues  for  an  entity  described  in  subsection  (a)(2)(B)(i).  The  Sec-

claims  data  submitted  by  participating  employment-based  plans 
under  this  section  to  ensure  that  such  plans  are  in  compliance 
with the requirements of this section. 

(e)  FUNDING.—There  is  appropriated  to  the  Secretary,  out  of 
the  Treasury  not  otherwise  appropriated, 
any  moneys 
$5,000,000,000  to  carry  out  the  program  under  this  section.  Such 
funds shall be available without fiscal year limitation.
