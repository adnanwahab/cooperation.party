everyone see what everyone code and zoom together man 
code robot and so on other
everyone see what everyone zoom
who see who zoom ? idk 

find andrew from famo.us
show this
write down This tool exists for within certain companies
which means on zoom requery 
use it to debug surge pricing for outliers like 
use to it debug surge pricing for house market - which means good deals
in travel and in real estate 
its too costly to to do at scale so mapbox + google cant do this yet.
make it easy for zoox 


KPIS 
Make as many good dataset as kaggle in 5 days 
improve housing market 
Make people more money by finding better deals on housing, and more.
Let users find everything they truly want via fly.io
make every dataset in the world public so all commerce is enriched.
visualize every office in the world and what they are doing. and if what they do actually improves the world a little for their users.

# Visualize Mind Magic - 



# directory structure

#data = data needed to run GPU computations on desktop
#src = compiled functions from jupyter directory
#vite project = frontend App



# Built IDE for Data Analysis, Robotics, GovTech - think better @ office, research-lab & school.

# make this app make everyone in the world look like a hero

# true goal = make robotics IDE for sending requests to robotic consciousness

#export robotic face using cooperation -> each document may have multiple apps / routes ?

#linked diagrams make sense of the world and make it more navigable -> more you understand world as it is = better you can ask robots to make better

# IDE with database included and createed automagically for you
# finds data, prepares it, and combines it into something meaningful to create plans, predictions and 
# 100 free open source run by 100 volunteers - get them to make projects that help you get jobs -> host on your website -> plugin to dns/surge and host

# cut scope -> generate map + data from one sentence / paragraph.
# eventually IDE for robotics, geospatial, govtech.

Primary theme : visualize accelerating world progress
Eventually, robots will do everything humans can do
which will free up the human mind to make non-duplicated improvements to the system.

Competition will be obsolete due to increases in collaborative technology.

Psychedelics and integration work will increase collaboration such that
the standard of living of all beings increases to beyond that of america.

The standard of living in all countries will rise due to advancements in technology and collaborative psychological advancements due to psychedelics and integration therapy.

Science is for making improvements to the human condition.

to support eutopia - we have to expect more from each other and ourselves. 

our brains tripled in size in the last 7 million years. we are in the awkward phase of evolution. The software can't keep up with the hardware. 
Our brains are survival machines by design. Until we redesign them.
That is our purpose, to upgrade our mind software and transfer that understanding to the next generation. So the survival machine becomes a happiness machine.

make wisdom fun and cool. not just for devoted trainees. but for all beings equally. wisdom does not have to be earned. It can now be downloaded via visualization.

visualize ram dass + already free + esther perel + 

esther perel - perfection does not exist which is why we get attached to it.

part 0 = math
part 1 = mind
1. 100% fruitional + 20% developmental - three.js cube - write caption from already free
2. tyranny of self image 
3.

visualize-value but 3d+animation+longer captions w/ citations

shel bernstein makes an omni-course where everyone contributes to a wiki-compendium of all information that needs to be taught to be successfull in life.

wisdom is earned. wisdom is useful. but wisdom must be relearned or else it cannot be easily applied. Closer you get to the present moment, the more wisdom you can bring into it. Using modern design, we can append wisdom to the memory of all humans so that they have easier lives. 



omni course has 2 branches for now (parts of god)
1. math
2. mind (psychology, neuroscience, math, physics, spirituality)
(requests for collaboration)

by contributing to this book you have made my dreams come true and yours too.

the point of zoox is to reuse self-driving car knowledge to enrich the next generation to make a million unicorns and lots of robotics-scientists to make AGI
cars are only the beginning, at zoox we will create armies of robots to rebuild and empower the earth

make your code more meaningful by making it literate so you remember wtf it was doing and 

this book is g-rated and meant for the advanced beginner and hidden genius within everyone but especially kindergarderners because the simpler the code the better the author because the easier it is to understanding
simplicity is the mark of true skill. 
make something worth forking and watch the world transform

Glossary 
Nature = Everything = God 
Mind = Pinnacle of Reality
Music = idk harmonies - music theorists please make fugue visualizations 
Spirituality = refine mind
Truth = Reality as it is without belief 
Data = closest thing to Truth
Humans can never capture the Truth, they can only get asymptotical 

part 0 = kill math basics (study linear algebra, statistics+probability+naive bayes+stochastic gradient descent, real analysis, trig)
part 1 = [AI, data visualization, simulation]
part 2 = Visualizing the Human Mind or Brain [NeuroScience, Spirituality, Math]
part 3 = world transforming mind = robots rebuild earth + genomics create arcology cities

Each chapter needs a research paper to proof ideas

self-teachers are too practical, but be a pragmatic implementator
academics tend to be too ivory tower and reductionist and dogmatic and afraid of showing their code .

papers-with-code is the answer
make observable into papers with code and make a book out of it. thats observable's purpose

together we can make observablehq displace wikipedia by keeping this collection of documents universally resonant.

I want every line and character to be scrutinized closely by every single person at zoox. 

No PR gets approved until it has 2500 +1s or unanimous consensus and resonance across 500 constituents for 5 editors who are voted in and replaced yearly. 


This book is to upgrade the education for the next generation so they can make AGI and correct the world in ways that we could not. They are more capable than they believe and its our responsibility to show it to them,

i know half of you are bored while the government is approving the car to be released. 

This 20% time project will create extreme cross pollination between us and other walled gardens.

We can dissolve the boundaries between companies, eliminate duplication of work and crystallized human effort like modules and create a better more harmonious.


If we can work together on this book series, we can do anything. I believe in you. if you use the capabilities i have bestowed upon you then you are limitless far beyond the design of god.

extend other peoples theories, adapt ideas, see connections, and adapt code to conform to mental model
visualize the mind as 
curtain with rube goldberg machine pulling strings -> whats in the machine?
phenomenological binding problems
mind is a sand dune with rolling particles 
mind is a circular buffer 
mind is append only but memories fade
federated identity - russian doll abstraction - reveal details in permission/roles/iam ethereum
visualize ethereum network 

visualize mind as iceberg freezing and refreezing

visualize entropic brain
visualize strucutre of mind matter phenomena 

visualize what is projection - memories colored by state dependent access and emotions
visualize kapi's metaphors
visualize buddhist metaphors - i am not a tea-cup

use simulation to visualize
use visualization to understand systems that underpin economony 

Have zoox make diagrams which support optimal consciousness by showing glimpses of true nature of reality and mind matter phenomena 

visualize what is optimal consciousness and systems which support it

visualize layers of computer 


visualize layers that underpin economy and casual factor

visualize anomaly detection

# todo
reorder top section and leave rest as todo 

- [ ] add 30 regl.party + 7 austin-eng
- [ ] extend and implement bret victors ideas 
- [ ] extend and visualize ideas which implement stream [2024]
- [ ] make framework which supports science, ai, visualization, data science - 3 months 
- [ ] make talk that takes alan kay's ideas and paper and starts movement to continue bret victors work 



alan kay -------> bret victor 
|                  |
V                   |
others -------------->

accumulate in structured manner to 100 billion accumulated wisdom and knowledge so next 8 billion are more happy 

happy = default state when informed about progress 


# table of contents
how to write a map with lots of data
how to write a particle simulation
how to write a hand writing neural net
how to redesign your mind/fate with learning about unconscious biases

how to program an AI with voice and a nodegraph with compute shaders
how to import a server-side trained model into the browser for more intelligent applications

how to implement/design the hardware needed to drive a car with robotics - 5 parts
simulation, planning, control, prediction, perception

# purpose of course
get kindergarderners to play with simulations and learn cool stuff with sliders
inspire the advanced beginners with a clear staircase to build their dreams at a startup or their dream job
give self-learners a path to get a job by learning new skills that are useful
get self-learners a job with giving research papers to spike on for companies
improve scientific and computer education in schools and student-teacher relationships by showing kids why to learn science (make cool stuff)

mixture of visualize-value, SICP, cs183, fast-ai.
get observable + reflect taught in school (mindmap-tony-buzan)

## how to learn
find the source of the source of your teachers - walk up chain of logic/distillation cause lots of stuff gets lots in translation
example : d3 -> heer -> immens
example: yoga -> bhagvad gita or yoga-> taoism/

the meaning of hardship is that  you can use it to understand more and create more wisdom
so you can transfer it to the next generation so they have easier, better lives 

we can do this using visualization and 4d graphics in the browser to make the world a better place to live. 

part 0 kill math
part 1 graphics + scientific visualization and visualization of graphics
part 2 visualzing AI and client-side AI - 4 years from now distil.pub
part 3 visualzing the mind
part 4 = robots building better cities and genomics - 7 years from now 


# theme or influences
SICP + observable + ram dass + the studio + webGPU + alan kay + bret victor + visual zen koans 

keep visualize mind magic as a growth funnel into observablehq - side project 

try react for book binding.js to toggle code-hiding and stuff
all you need is tailwind


i want the world to teach itself more - and for people to help me teach so everyone's smarter
world has information overload - making sense of that information = magic 
AI = magic because it helps make sense of world that is beyond logic because logic is sometime incomplete.
absolutes and generalizations are useful and somewhat-necessary because they save time or else you'd just remain confused
brain is not a truth machine, but its the closest thing we've got. 
you're not the mind, you have one and it has properties 
cure all malladies of the mind with a software upgrade - we can finish what krishnamurthi and buddha could not.
I can't do it alone.
We only need 600 bonfire creators to fix wikipedia's lack of interactive content which can illustrate and demonstrate what images alone cannot.

redblobgames.com + pudding.cool + SICP + observable + ram dass + the studio + webGPU + alan kay + bret victor + visual zen koans 

everyone in the world becoming a contributor instead of just a spectator. 
make a better wikipedia -> send a community driven message 
convince wikipedia to use better software including webGPU in 3 years.
convince wikpedia to use observablehHQ as their document 
eventually get wikipedia founders to help implement LARP-economy

get wikipedia to make each edit voted on by 51% of members 
get wikipedia to use better more collaborative software using observablehq.com
make observablehq acquire wikipedia and instrument knowledge synthesis AI

make wikipedia more collaborative
wikipedia reflects status quo too much 
# glossary
mind magic = AI + the computer as extension to the mind + fact that mind can do math
culture = miracle that we all understand the same things 
smarts = amount of useful knowledge in head, including ability to create new useful knowledge 


# goal 
teach collaboration skills by finding out what they are and clearly defining them better than any where else 
gottman-thought-world
make a course for advanced beginners 
make everyone a 100x engineer/designer/scientist

engineer skills -
   refactoring for simplfiication - example = rawWEBGPU-> framework code -> knowing stack at all levels and tweaking each part to be 10x simpler

meta-self-programming - to be defined 



The unabomber thought impossible problems would be too hard and all the medium problems were used up
easy problems are all done
medium problems are taken by other people
impossible problems are now solvable using collaboaration which is the ultimate skill
there are a lot of smart people mad at the world because the world isnt good enough

theres millions of disefranchised people like 

make 1 billion wizards
Advanced prgamatic philosophy for hackers 

5 modules for now
1. big data visualization 
2. using speech to instruct AI to make computer graphics

technology solves the human condition by creating freedom from the mind
technology has an inherently spiritual bent because it extends the mind 
together we can make 7 billion buddah+alan kay hybrids

# make simple staircase to 100x engineer - paul graham
1. work hard to understand best ideas of other people and create your own for other people to cherish.
2. make something people want
3. make map that shows noisest neighborhood/hexagon in multiple resolutions

you can be the protagonist or you can be the author of the world's story

don flamingo quote - winners are the ones who decide history

making a new computational medium like pudding.cool and distil.pub to teach 100x engineer skills to 1 billion people

find 

there's no limit to the demand for design and engineering 
we could have 10x as many 100x designers/engineers making star-forges, fusion and cure cancer.
We don't have enough talent. Thats why it takes so long to build things and thats why most things are filled with bugs.

It's your job to find the limits of the system and remove them.
The system is everywhere you go. Everything you touch. It is the state of the world 
Make an homage to the matrix and say you can change the code of the systems that govern the behavior of the world's systems. 

You can create things for billions of people to consume. Observablehq can get more viewers than netflix. 

The world is changing. Think of tiktok overtaking instagram. The future belongs to creators. Who stitch together the ideas of others and remix them into wonderous creations. 

it may be comforting to think it was inevitable but it wasnt.
if you think you have infinite free will, then you have more than you think - menno henselman
Think of designing in code as a new art form, and you can use it to shape the world.

psychedelics will cause the recession to end permanently, because they will instigate a surge in progress by making the mind more optimal, malleable, and ductile. The mind wants to expand infinitely - kyle henry.

I'm starting this school for everyone to become gifted and talented at whatever subspeciality of AI-driven art you choose to create.

This school is designed to teach you how to create AI-Scientific-Art Tools to create your dreams automagically for you using armies of robots. 

universally resonant tone. must resonate in as many subminds by unifying subminds

simple unified theory of all knowledge distilled down into visual 4d memes, visual proofs, illusions, and visual zen koans)

please cross-reference ideas and add your favorite books and research papers to an observable notebook and references section.

wikipedia + spiritiual successor to SICP 

take over wikipedia and add visual diagrams, and notebooks for citations.

TODO : add DAO for code is law 



everyone is in a universe unto themself - everyone lives and interacts with a simulation that is constructed from sensory 

Everyone has a copy of the universe in their mental software.

We can upgrade this software by creating the right visualizations. 

visualize person sitting in room 

make everyone in the world a True Student of 

Always be learnining

More you learn, the more you can create.

The point of creation is to have fun seeing your creation dancing in 8 billion universes. 


kill math - see the world prosper more when you increase the knowledge of everyone by 20% 

Knowledge gaining is exponential because the more you learn, the more you can reach other farther into the unknown.


#7 year goal 
AGI will first be written in python, rust or C++. But then we will write it in javascript.

we only understand what we can create.

the first purpose of life is to understand the mind and the secrets of the cosmos. The mind has the laws of nature which can be studied via meditation and meditative hacking


# requsst for implementation
* low-code no-code AI generative ART using compute shaders
* cool beans




# KPIs 
1. money that we have made people 
2. all worlds problems measured to be solved specifically in high resolution in 6-20 years.
3. start small -> measure 311 in every city 
   make a jupyter notebook -> chart 

# 10 biggest problems measured in each phone, home, neighborhood, city, state, 
each phone has a exabyte of metadata about everyone else's data - so everyone can simulatenously communicate to everyone else -> meaning im riding my bike to yoga studio then going to office then having dinner with farah -> how does that fit into the picture of 7 billion people drawing an escher drawing -> contribute to the big picture of everyone's puzzle pieces fitting into a tapestry of cool stuff happenining over time 


zoom into everyones house - describe what working on


# identify, instrument and measure + lower technical risk = cool stuff built faster

# close enough but we'll get there faster when we know exactly how happy everyone.
# make yourself happy = make others happy.

# utopia = everyone happy = eta 2030 which means no serious complaints no problems



# ui for sims in everyones house
# theme safrai + theme hospital +
# simcity
# make everything work better 
# how well does everything work
# all the cars in the world -> 
# government has database of every licenese plate snapshot -> soem think creepy -> but this data should really belong to everyone
# at least all robot cars should be visualizable to everyone - cross industry standard -> important cause trolley problem - how could you \
# just use simulation -> say you have it. subsidize companies that do it. - make a map of what it looks like. show traffic reduced by 75%.
# make chart of how much stress is caused by driving. 
# its cool you can go anywhere. but we could gain so much more if it was like minority report where you can only drive outside city limits -> get this done by 2023
# find out who is doing this -> upload all your text + meme based screenshots -> make interactive picture book automaticalyl for people of content that is relevant.
# starcraft mode = see robots make shit
# satellites -> make a notebook of

# MFE -> observable web components + 
# make 95% of all databases publicly readable + polyfill this -> 311 in all cities
## measure upside -> 
# jupyter functions w/ tests

4 biggest fears - you should talk to someone lori gottlieb

1000 datums per city
what percentage parks -> make a script and fetch reflect.url and then save to disk.
1. using public data dumps of IOT - find these 
2. sateliites might 
3. robots and shit
4. people hand editing maps and shit
5. 311
6.

make a ai -> reads your "identiy" tells you who you are like jc denton - not useful
research helios and people inspired by that -> less wrong -> 


# make a dataset of all people projects and how cool and when + effort
like kaggle but reproducability




# Influences
1. dynamic land in the browser -> write down whatever -> plan on how to make a vaccine
2. reflect + jupyter + obs (reactive variable model but client + fly.io(db) + desktop)
3. write sentences -> each one makes a diagram -> edits real world -> plants a tree -> build house w/ robots
4. starcraft mode but add pylons - measure apm + effective resource utilization (everyone in government wants to see how each resource is utilized - make more people vote)
